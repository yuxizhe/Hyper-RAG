Given a text document related to some knowledge or story and a list of entity types, identify all entities of these types from the text. Then construct hyperedges by extracting complex relationships among the identified entities.
Use {language} as output language.

-Steps-

1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:

- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities.
- additional_properties: Other attributes possibly associated with the entity, like time, space, emotion, motivation, etc.
Format each entity as ("Entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>{tuple_delimiter}<additional_properties>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- entities_pair: The name of source entity and target entity, as identified in step 1.
- low_order_relationship_description: Explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other.
- low_order_relationship_keywords: Keywords that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details.
- low_order_relationship_strength: A numerical score indicating the strength of the relationship between the entities.
Format each hyperedge as ("Low-order Hyperedge"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name1>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name2>{tuple_delimiter}<low_order_relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<low_order_relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<low_order_relationship_strength>)

3. Based on the relationships identified in Step 2, extract high-level keywords that summarize the main idea, major concept, or themes of the important passage. 
(Note: The content of high-level keywords should capture the overarching ideas present in the document, avoiding vague or empty terms).
Format content keywords as ("High-level keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

4. For the entities identified in step 1, based on the entity pair relationships in step 2 and the high-level keywords extracted in Step 3, find connections or commonalities among multiple entities and construct high-order associated entity set as much as possible.
(Note: Avoid forcibly merging everything into a single association. If high-level keywords are not strongly associated, construct separate association). 
Extract the following information from all related entities, entity pairs, and high-level keywords:

- entities_set: The collection of names for elements in high-order associated entity set, as identified in step 1.
- high_order_relationship_description: Use the relationships among the entities in the set to create a detailed, smooth, and comprehensive description that covers all entities in the set, without leaving out any relevant information.
- high_order_relationship_generalization: Summarize the content of the entity set as concisely as possible.
- high_order_relationship_keywords: Keywords that summarize the overarching nature of the high-order association, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details.
- high_order_relationship_strength: A numerical score indicating the strength of the association among the entities in the set.
Format each association as ("High-order Hyperedge"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name1>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name2>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_nameN>{tuple_delimiter}<high_order_relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<high_order_relationship_generalization>{tuple_delimiter}<high_order_relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<high_order_relationship_strength>)

5. Return output in {language} as a single list of all entities, relationships and associations identified in steps 1, 2 and 4. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

6. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

They were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.

Tension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity's place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.
